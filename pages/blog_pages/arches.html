                </figure>
                <p>Double Arch takes its name because of it consists of two arcs that share the same stone as a foundation for both of their outer legs. Interesting fact that Double Arch was formed differently from most of the arches in the park. This arch was formed by water erosion from above rather than more typical erosion from the side. </p>
